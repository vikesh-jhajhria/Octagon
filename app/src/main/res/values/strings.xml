    <string name="live_tours_video_heading">Come To The Holyland On A Live Octagon Project Tour</string>
    <string name="live_tours_video_description">An Octagon Tour is the only tour of it’s kind in the Holy Land, because we focus exclusively on the life of Jesus. Every site we take you to is referred to in the Gospels. (Check out our itinerary on this page, and you will see what we mean.) This means that you will be visiting all of the sites that you really came to see.\n\nEvery day we will put you in the three-foot circle of Jesus. You will walk where He walked, sit where He taught, and stand where He did His miracles. All of our guides are Christians, and our itinerary has been designed by Gary Crossland himself. The Merged Gospels is our field guide for our entire trip.\n\nMost of our travelers who have been to Israel before with other tours tell us that ours is about 75% unique. The reason is simple – it’s ALL about Jesus.\n\nThroughout 2016 we have focused our attention on launching The Octagon Project virtual tour. Very soon we will be restarting our Octagon Live Tours to Israel.\n\nAnd what about safety? Don’t be misguided by the media. People are coming to Israel by the droves from all over the world. The fact is that at any moment the safest place to be in the Holy Land is on a tour bus. Since Israel became a sovereign state in 1948 literally no one who has been a part of a tour group has ever been injured or killed there. The reason? Tourists bring money, and everyone wants to sell you something, including the Palestinians. Hence, everyone likes tourists.\n\nPlease get on our mailing list by submitting your contact information here, and we will notify you when we will be taking our next tour to Israel.</string>
