There are 30 tours in The Octagon Project. In every tour there will be a free introductory video, which you can access by becoming a "lite" subscriber. All of the other videos on each tour require that you purchase that particular tour. When you purchase any tour, you will be able to watch all the 360Â° videos on your computer and mobile devices, and in virtual reality with any smartphone or VR headgear.</string>
